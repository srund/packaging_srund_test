# packaging_srund_test
Following the Python packaging tutorial.

As described by [this link](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

## Stages

    1.  Making a simple Python module. Naming and content roughly what the
        tutorial suggest.
    2.  Project toml-file. Choosing `setuptools` as build system as I have
        personally seen it in actual use more often than other systems.
        Filling in other fields appropriately.
